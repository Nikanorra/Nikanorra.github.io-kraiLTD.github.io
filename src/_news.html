                <p>With another successful round of submissions to MLCommons' MLPerf Inference done and dusted, our team at KRAI reflected on one of our most exciting achievements in this round, affectionately known as KILT. 
                  And no, we are not talking about the traditional Scottish garment, although it did inspire the name!</p>

                <p class="description">Nvidia Dominates MLPerf Inference, Qualcomm also Shines, Whereâ€™s Everybody Else?</p>
                <p>MLCommons today released its latest MLPerf inferencing results, with another strong showing by Nvidia accelerators inside a diverse array of systems. 
                  Roughly four years old, MLPerf still struggles to attract wider participation from accelerator suppliers. 
                  Nevertheless, overall performance and participation was up, with 19 organizations submitting twice as many results and six times as many power measurements in the main Inference 2.0 (datacenter and edge) exercise. Bottom line: AI systems are steadily improving.</p>
