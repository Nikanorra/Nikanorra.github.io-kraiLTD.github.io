          <p class="animate__animated animate__lightSpeedInRight animate__delay-2s description">Established in 2020, KRAI was founded and is led by Dr. Anton Lokhmotov out of Cambridge, UK. Anton got exposed in a direct way to the impact of the Cambridge tech cluster, otherwise known as ‘Silicon Fen’, which inspired his PhD studies and guided his work in industry with organizations like ARM and MLCommons. Recognizing the growing importance of AI and the limitations of current computer systems, KRAI and its technologies were created and to serve tier 1 industry partners, like Qualcomm.</p>
